WEEK 10 NOV 6

This week is the PCB soldered milestone. I picked up my PCB from Prototype Lab and started soldering. Last week, I need to resend my correct gerber files because first time I made some problems with Fritzing (there were shorts and PCB can be made much smaller). In lab time today, I made mistakes when soldering the wrong sides on PCB. However, I learned how to use desoldering and put them back again.     


Here are my PCB after soldering:
