Color Portable Device
WEEK 12 NOV 20

This week is for Case encloses development platform and custom PCB. I worked on CorelDraw to design a custom case for my platform. Prepare the presentation for next week.
WEEK 11 NOV 13

This week is the power-up part. I connected my sensor with the PCB and Raspberry Pi. After connecting through Remote Desktop Control, I followed the instruction from [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-color-sensors/python-circuitpython) to import Python code to my RPI and powered up sensor for data reading (the light sensor works by shining a white light at an object and then recording the reflected colour (the percentage of RGB). It can also record the intensity of the reflection (brightness).Financial updates: Remain same, no new parts need to buy. 
Plan for next week: Design a case for RPI and PCB (laser cut case from prototype lab)
Here are some reading results:

WEEK 10 NOV 6

This week is the PCB soldered milestone. I picked up my PCB from Prototype Lab, got the header pins and started soldering. Last week, I had to resend my Gerber files because the first time I made some problems with Fritzing (there were shorts and PCB can be made much smaller). In lab time today, I made mistakes when soldering the wrong sides on PCB. However, I learned how to use desoldering and put them back again in proper position. According to my [Project Proposal](https://github.com/SuongLuong/Portable-Color-Dectection-Device/blob/master/ProposalContent-SuongLuong.xlsx)
      


Here are my PCB after soldering:
