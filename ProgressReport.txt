Progress Report
+ Recent project activities with reference to my project schedule: 
	Finish setting up my Raspberry Pi program.
	Finish the soldering part, attach my sensor on breadboard and connect it with raspberry Pi.
	Check the address I chose from the beginning.

	Right now I think I'm right on my schedule for working on hardware.

+ Current progress:
	On software course: Build a general application which has all the basic function. However, it need to be connected with the hardware 
			database at least by the end of this semester.

+ Some problems: 
	Instead of connecting by VGA port, I am having a problem with connecting Pi and PC through Ethernet cable and Remote Desktop Control. 
	Solution: See the instruction on github to figure out Pi configuration (IP address) and connect it again.

+ Financial updates: 
	No other parts have been bought except:
	Buy Ethernet cable to connect Pi and computer.
	Buy wireless mouse and keyboard for navigation. 

+ Links to some published media I used for setting up: 
	https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/colour-sensing-raspberry-pi/  ---> i used this one to connect Pi and sensor

+ Plan for next week: Get my PCB soldered and make some test.
